%Goal: come up with worlds where robots cannot be collected

% given a map,randomly distribute n robots (non overlapping)

% then, count the number of connected components

% pick a point in two different connected components (pA and pB)

% Use BFS to move pA and pB until they are part of the same connected comonent 

% repeat 100x or until all pieces are one connected component.
