%\subsection{Milli-scale, Magnetic-Based Prototype}
To demonstrate the algorithm, we developed a magnetic control stage and alginate micro-particles.

We designed a custom magnetic control stage to generate the global control inputs. 
This stage generates a magnetic drag force by moving a permanent magnet. 
This permanent magnet can translate in $x$ and $y$-axes, actuated by stepper motors and moving on linear rails. 
The neodymium permanent magnet field strength is 433 mT and dimensions are 25.4$\times$25.4 mm$^2$. 
 The assembly workspace is made of PDMS that is cured in a 3D-printed PLA mold.
The mold channels are 500 $\mu$m wide and 800 $\mu$m deep. 
Channels are then filled with motility buffer. 
All microrobots used for these experiments are loaded alginate paramagnetic hydrogels, otherwise known as artificial cells. 
The alginate microrobots were fabricated using a centrifugal method, as described in previous work \cite{ ali2016fabrication}.
 The average microrobot size is 300 $\mu$m, and were composed of a concentration of 5\% (w/v) Alginate-Na and 5\% (w/v) concentration of CaCl$_2$, and then impregnated with 5\% (w/v)  nano-paramagnetic particles (Iron oxide, Sigma-Aldrich). 


After the alginate microrobots were loaded at each hopper in the microfluidic factory layout, the experimental channel was placed at the center of the stage. 
Next, the magnet centered beneath the microfluidic factory layout. 
This position was saved as the home position for the permanent magnet. 
Stepper motors controlled the stage position. 
An Arduino UNO programmed in C++ commanded these stepper motors using a 2Hz control loop. 
After a command was initiated, such as each direction in the $ \langle u,r,d,l \rangle$ sequence, the permanent magnet was returned to the home position to better control the distribution of the magnetic gradient.  
The layout was observed through a stereomicroscope and the installed camera (Motion Pro X3) captured the procedure at 30 fps. Using 0.65x magnification in the stereomicroscope, the observed field of view is 23.6 $\times$ 18.9 mm$^2$.
  A system schematic is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Magneticstage}. 


\paragraph{Experimental result}
Using a factory layout generated by Alg.~\ref{alg:BuildFactory}, we demonstrated micro-scale assembly using multiple alginate microrobots. The initial scene is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Construction}(a) and the first assembly operation was orchestrated by moving the magnet in a clockwise direction, following the $ \langle u,r,d,l \rangle$  sequence as indicated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Construction}(b). Each input was applied sufficiently long to ensure all alginate microrobots moved until they touched a wall. The completed square polyomino is shown in the lower right corner in Fig.~\ref{fig:Construction}(c). In addition, other square polyominoes were manufactured simultaneously.
