Two of the three reviewers agreed that the paper has been improved in
order to fit with the standard of IEEE-RAL. One of them said that there
is still a room of improvement for the paper before publication at this
journal. 
I suggest that the authors consider the different remarks, particularly
and carefully the comments of this latter reviewer, for a revised and
improved version of the paper.
