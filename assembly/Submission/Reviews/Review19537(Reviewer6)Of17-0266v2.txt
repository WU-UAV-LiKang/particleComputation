The authors have done a good job of answering my previous comments
along with the comments of the other reviewers. However, many of the
explanation in the rebuttal document did not make it into the final
version of the paper. Incorporating them into the final version of the
paper will help clarify many points.

Some specific comments on this version are the following:

Please define "polyominoe" in the introduction where it is first
mentioned.

Fig.11 - label the magnet in this figure.

In the video for the micro-scale experiments, it seems like the
particles move over the borders of the factory walls.  Can you explain
this?  Also, the attachments of the particles keep changing although
they are not designed to do so.  It just so happens in the end that
they end up in the desired configuration.  It would be helpful to show
more than one experiment here to get some idea of the robustness of the
system.

Finally, for the assembly shown in Fig.1 - would something like this
actually be possible at the microscale?  How can you get part 7 to stop
precisely at the top and attach to part 6 instead of moving down and
attach to part 4 or 2?
