Video attachment for “Parallel Self-Assembly under Uniform Control Inputs”
by Sheryl Manzoor, Sam Sheckman, Jarrett Lonsford, Hoyeon Kim, Minjun Kim, and Aaron T. Becker.

Video a simulated particle assembly factory that generates multiple copies of a polyomino.  Next a macro-scale hardware demonstration using gravity as the global input shows assembly using magnetic attraction between particles.  The final clip shows micro-scale assembly using magnetically controlled particles.
