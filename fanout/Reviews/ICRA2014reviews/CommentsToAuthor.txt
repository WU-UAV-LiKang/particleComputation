The reviewers are generally positive about this paper. In
particular, the strength of the matrix permutation
techniques is mentioned by several reviewers. Some issues
are raised regarding the novelty of the PSPACE-completeness
proof, and the reviewers suggest that the connection to
robotics applications be made more strongly. Some minor
errors should also be fixed in Figure 2.    (FIXED)
