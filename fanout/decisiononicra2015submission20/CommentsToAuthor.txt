The paper tries to give a solution to the computational
problem in a mechanical form for a multi particle system,
improving a previous contribution of the same authors. The
solution, passing through the design of a suitable fan-out
gate, let one get a full computational result. 

As evidenced by the reviewers, both the different kind of
system considered and a poor discussion of the results give
a certain weakness to the paper. A certain effort should be
devoted to clarify the points touched by the reviewers.
