 It will be helpful to define the dual-rail logic before Section 3. [[defined in 1.b]]

In Lemma 1, what does "or if r fails to hit robots it did hit before" mean? [[Given a workspace $W$, a command sequence $\bm{m}$, and a robot $r$ traveling along a path beginning at location $\bm{s}$, this path can only be changed by introducing a new robot that $r$ hits, or by removing one of the robots that $r$ hit before.]]

In the proof of Corollary 5, it is not clear why "Because W is conservative
there must also be one additional input location sr and robot r."   [[changed $W$ to particle logic ]]

The IDs of the figures are out of order. 

In Figure 5 and 4, <d, l, d, r> should be <d, l, u, r>.  [[fixed]]

In Figure 4, <d> should be <d, l>.  [[fixed]]

In the conclusion, it is not clear how the necessity of dual-rail logic for Boolean logic was established in this paper. 

Finally, I would not call a particle a nanorobot. 
[[[ we use the word ÔnanoÕ 5 times:
1.) We present fundamental progress on the computational universality of swarms of micro- or nano-scale robots in complex environments
2.) One of the exciting new directions of robotics is the design and development of micro- and nanorobot systemsÓ
3.) As a consequence, current micro- and nanorobot systems with many robots are steered and directed by an external force that acts as a common control signal
4.)  it establishes that future nano-scale systems are able to perform
arbitrarily complex operations
5.) This work, along with \cite{Becker2013f,Becker2014,Becker2014a}, introduces a
new model for mechanical computation.  Interesting applications will aim at 
nanoscale and microfluidics work.

Namely, even the title of their previous paper published at ICRA 2014 is wrong: “Particle
Computation: Designing Worlds to Control Robot Swarms with
only Global Signals” instead of “Particle computation:
Controlling robot swarms with only global signals”.  [[[fixed]]]]


The paper is too lengthy to present content that sometimes is
not that new or irrelevant. For instance, what is the point
of Table II? Logical operations are well-known in
engineering and computer science – this can be simply
removed.   [[[[ REMOVED ]]]]

Anyway, the most flimsy part of the paper are the
experimental results. Section V describes a prototype
though most of it mainly focus on the description of the
setup instead of discussing the results obtained. As such,
it is rather hard to grasp the relevance of the addition of
the FAN-OUT gate and, as such, the whole contribution of
the work.
