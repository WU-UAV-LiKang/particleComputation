Video attachment for "Particle Computation: Device Fan-Out and Binary Memory" by Hamed Mohtasham Shad, Rose Morris-Wright, Erik D. Demaine, SÃ¡ndor P. Fekete, Aaron T. Becker, at MIT, TU Braunschweig, and the University of Houston. 

We present progress on the computational universality of swarms of micro- or nano-scale robots in complex environments, controlled by a uniform global, external force.

We consider a 2D grid world, in which all obstacles and robots are unit squares, and for each actuation, robots move maximally until they collide with an obstacle or another robot. 

We design configurations to implement AND, OR, NOR,and NAND logic gates and a FAN-OUT gates, necessary for simulating arbitrary digital circuits, and give instructions for wiring logic gates together.  As an example we connect our logic elements to produce a 3-bit counter.
