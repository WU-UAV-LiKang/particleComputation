We present fundamental progress on the computational universality of swarms of nano-scale robots\
in complex environments, controlled not by individual navigation, but by a uniform global, external force.\

\
Consider a 2D grid world, in which all obstacles and robots are unit squares,\
and for each actuation, robots move maximally until they collide with an\
obstacle or another robot. In previous work, we demonstrated components of \\emph\{particle computation\} in this\
world, designing obstacle configurations that implement \{\\sc and\} and \{\\sc or\}\
logic gates:  by using dual-rail logic, we designed \{\\sc not, nor, nand, xor,\
xnor\} logic gates. However, we were unable to design a \{\\sc fan-out\} gate, which\
is necessary for simulating the full range of complex interactions\
that are present in arbitrary digital circuits. In this work we resolve this \
problem by proving unit-sized robots \{\\em cannot\} generate a \{\\sc fan-out\} gate.  \
On the positive side, we resolve the missing component with the help of \
2$\\times$1 robots, which can create fan-out gates that produce multiple copies\
of the inputs.  Using these gates we are able to establish the full range\
of computational universality as presented by complex digital circuits.  As\
an example we connect our logic elements to produce a 3-bit counter.  We also\
demonstrate how to implement a data storage element.\

(OLD REVIEW of ICRA 2014 paper: Despite some of the strong assumptions necessary for both\
the analysis and also the physical implementation (e.g.,\
rails to avoid bearings from "hopping" in unintended\
directions), the presented work is both interesting and\
compelling.)\
